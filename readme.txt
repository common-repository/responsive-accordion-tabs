Add stylish tabs to your website that convert to accordions on smaller screens

== Description ==
Tabs can look ugly and unresponsive on smaller screens, whilst being highly effective on larger screens. With this plugin you have the best of both worlds as they will respond to the screen size and either show as tabs or accordions.

With the pro version you can choose to display the tabs vertically as well as horizontally, and set custom colours to match your theme.
